IMPORTANT - If creating or delting a new file and or folder. ensure to reflect this change in phonics-flashcards.xcodeproj to avoid breaking it. this is because changes outside of xcode do not track these changes automatically

1 - The progress bar at the group level reflects free but should probaly relfect free and premium combined e.g there is 5 free and 5 premium cards under a group and a user finished 1 card. this currently reflects 20% finished in the progress bar insteaad of only 10 though the user is a free user - thougts on this.

2 - I'm confiused what sessions even means and if it is actually useful.

3 - Ensure there is privacy policy and we are adhering to these poilices as per the apple developer documentaion.

4 -  I want each group to be color coded using soft pastel colors. currently the app is fully blue which looks nice but is kinda dull for a kids app

5 - improve error handling to ensure it adheres to best practices

6 - add a dark, light, system theme in the settings menu
